# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building an end-to-end *House Price Prediction system* using Machine Learning techniques.  
The objective is to predict house prices based on multiple features after performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation.

 
## 📌 Project Overview

The workflow includes: 
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling 
- Training and comparing multiple regression models
- Model evaluation using *cross-validation (R² score)*
- Hyperparameter tuning using *GridSearchCV*
- Visualizing model performance using prediction plots 

After comparing different models, *Gradient Boosting Regressor* was selected as the final model and achieved an *R² score of ~89%*.


## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

The following regression models were trained and evaluated:
- Support Vector Regression
- Linear Regression  
- Stochastic Regressor
- Gaussian Process Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  

Cross-validation was used to fairly compare model performance.


## ⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning was performed on the best-performing model (*Gradient Boosting Regressor) using **GridSearchCV* to further improve performance.

Parameters tuned include:
- n_estimators
- max_depth
- learning_rate



## 📊 Model Performance Visualization

The plot below shows the relationship between *Actual vs Predicted House Prices* on validation data.

The closer the points are to the diagonal line, the better the model’s predictions.
